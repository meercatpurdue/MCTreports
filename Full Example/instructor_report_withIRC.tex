\section*{How Did Your Students Answer the Questions?}
This section details how your students answered each of the questions.  The ``item response curves'' (IRCs) show how students with different overall test scores answered the questions.  

\subsection*{How to Read the IRC Plots}

\subsubsection*{Top Plot: Histogram of Total Scores}
The top plot is a histogram of the students' total test scores. It is repeated above every IRC for easy reference.  The information in the IRC is most reliable for the total test scores that students earned most frequently because the information is averaged over many students.  Thus, the information in the IRCs for the extreme scores is less reliable than the information near the median score.

\subsubsection*{Bottom Plot: IRCs}
The IRC plots should be read vertically for each total score.  In other words, for a given total test score, instructors should read vertically to see what proportion of students with that score selected a given answer choice.

However, the pattern of the proportion of a given answer option across total test scores can also be insightful.  
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ideally, the correct answer should draw an `s-shaped' curve when viewing the responses from lowest to highest total score.  This s-shaped curve indicates that the item clearly discriminates between those who understand the concept and those who do not, and it also likely reflects the validity and clarity of the question.
	\item IRCs for incorrect answers that look like inverted s-curves (higher for low scores and curving down to no responses for high scores) indicate high-functioning distractors.  These answers probably correspond to common misconceptions about the topic being assessed.
	\item Answer options that were chosen infrequently across all total test scores are low-functioning distractors because students do not consider them viable answers. You may want to revise or replace these answer choices.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \underline{Example:}  Suppose answer "C" was a popular choice for lower-performing students, and answer "B" (the correct answer) was popular with higher-performing students.  This scenario may imply that answer "C" is a common misconception that the instructor may want to address in class.

\subsubsection*{Summary and More Information} 
In summary, instructors can quickly look at the IRC patterns of: (i) lower-performing students to better understand what misconceptions the students may be harboring, and (ii) higher-performing students for evidence of question validity.  \\
